## 👋 Hi, I'm Richard Adleta

**Hands‑On Software Architect & Principal Engineer** with 20 + years designing  
and coding scalable, cloud‑native platforms that:

- **Send 25 M + emails/day** through a 50‑server grid (.NET Core, AWS).  
- **Serve 6.8 M yearly page views** to 1.5 M learners on a serverless kids‑education site.  
- **Index 80 M + résumés** and job posts for sub‑second searches (Elasticsearch).  

My sweet spot is writing production code while guiding architecture so teams can  
ship faster, safer, and smarter.

## 🚀 What Sets Me Apart

| Strength | Snapshot Impact |
| -------- | --------------- |
| **Hands‑On Problem Solver** | Built AI Assistant framework automating email, web‑page, and job‑posting creation (C#, OpenAI GPT). |
| **Scale‑First Architect** | Engineered horizontally scalable email system and 50‑node compute cluster for near real‑time data processing. |
| **Leadership with Code** | As CTO & Lead Architect, scaled orgs (20 → 150 staff) while committing code daily. |
| **End‑to‑End Execution** | Own design, development, CI/CD, and cloud ops—ensuring ideas reach production reliably. |
