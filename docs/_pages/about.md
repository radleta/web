## **Hands‑On Software Architect & Principal Engineer**

Architect and principal engineer who ships production code every day—designing  
AI‑driven, cloud‑native platforms that:

- **Deliver 25 M + emails/day** via a 50‑server grid (C#, .NET Core, AWS).  
- **Serve 6.8 M yearly page views** to 1.5 M learners on a serverless kids‑education  
  site (ASP.NET MVC, React, DynamoDB).  
- **Index 80 M + résumés** and tens of millions of job postings for millisecond‑search  
  experiences (Elasticsearch, event‑driven design).

Over 20 years in the field, I’ve stayed relentlessly hands‑on—from my first C#  
web app in the early 2000s to building today’s generative‑AI assistants.  
Whether leading architecture at **Nexxt**, co‑founding **All Kids Network**, or  
scaling game tech at **Splinterlands**, the common thread is writing code that  
hits production and moves the needle.

### Journey Highlights

| Role & Company | Impact |
| -------------- | ------ |
| **Lead Architect, Nexxt (2023 – Present)** | Built an AI Assistant framework for email composition, landing‑page creation, and job‑posting automation, opening new revenue streams. |
| **Partner & Principal Engineer, All Kids Network (2014 – Present)** | Runs a 2.2 M‑member platform with sub‑30 ms responses, blue‑green deploys, and a 175 K weekly newsletter. |
| **CTO / Head of Product, Splinterlands (2021 – 2023)** | Scaled org from 20 → 150 staff, modernized AWS stack, and shipped player‑facing features on React & blockchain APIs. |

### Technologies & Expertise

**.NET 8, C#, ASP.NET MVC, React, Angular, TypeScript, SQL Server, DynamoDB,  
Redis, Elasticsearch, AWS (Lambda, S3, CloudFront, OpenSearch), Azure,  
event‑driven architecture, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins), AI & LLM  
integrations**

### How I Work

Builder first, leader second. I architect systems, write the core code, automate  
the pipeline, and mentor engineers—all in service of shipping something users  
love. My sweet spot lies at the intersection of performance, scale, and  
developer experience: clean domain models, observable services, and  
deploy‑on‑push workflows.

### Beyond Work

When I’m not optimising queries or tweaking TypeScript, you’ll find me deep into  
an RPG, hanging out with family, or experimenting with the next AI prototype.  
Games keep my creative edge sharp; family keeps me grounded.
