## Professional Summary

Senior software architect and full‑stack engineer with 20+ years of shipping production code and scaling cloud‑native, data‑intensive, and AI‑powered products. I design and build high‑throughput systems—like 25 M‑email‑per‑day pipelines, 80 M‑record search platforms, and AI assistants—using C#, .NET 6/8, Angular, React, TypeScript, SQL/NoSQL, and AWS. Known for translating fuzzy requirements into clean, testable code, I champion automation, performance, and observability while staying heads‑down in the repo. I thrive as an individual contributor who influences architecture through deep technical expertise and collaborative problem‑solving rather than formal management.
